# 3D fractal trees generator

## Description
A program that uses L-systems to generate fractal trees and OpenGL to animate them in 3D. 

Features include a rotating 3D model of a tree generated from these changeable parameters:
* tree branches and leaves density (i. e. depth of the recursion),
* wood and leaves color,
* tree's size,
* tree crown's breadth.

## Requirements
A Microsoft .NET redistributable installation is probably required to run.

## Quick start
Run `FractalTree\bin\Debug\FractalTree`.
